My Event Center Website is fairly straightforward. It has 5 connected webpages, a Home, Contact, Location, Menu, and Events page. There is a navbar at the top that allows you to navigate between 
the pages. My code is organized with the different pages each having their own HTML and CSS page. The CSS page has the responsive design elements at the bottom of the page.
