    <h3 class="title">About the Colosseum</h3>
    <p class="words">
    One of the only stadiums of its kind, the Colosseum has been the site of events such as basketball games, gymnastic competitions, hockey games, and 
    tennis matches. The arena can be converted to accomodate virtually any 
    athletic competition. It boasts an olympic-sized swimming pool, which can be closed to allow for a basketball court,
    ice rink, track, or other playing field to be positioned on top. In addition to enjoying
    the action down on the field, visitors to the Colosseum will
    also be treated to some of the finest dining in any venue.
    The various restaurants located around the concourse
    of the dome provide delicious options such as steak, lobster,
    and caviar, while the concession stands offer more conventional food
    such as hotdogs, pizza and beer. Be sure to check out the menu 
    page to see all the tasty options!
